title: Red brick 
---

This one is for those who could consider helping us acquire the rather large pile of bricks we need to create the foundation.
Maybe you see a bargain on finn.no, or know of someone tearing down a red brick something?
The bricks can gladly be re-purposed, as long as they follow the standard measurements of 108mm x 228mm x 62mm (Norwegian standard since 1840).

Every little piece helps.

Price? We have no idea.
We've seen prices for used as low as 3 NOK per brick and as new up to 40 NOK, so we would anyway prefer used.
