To make our greenhouse both higher, more spacious, and grand, we would like to construct it on top of a 60cm wall of red bricks.
For that, we need about 600 red bricks all-in--all, and we thought it would be amazing if as many as possible could contribute one brick.
There is something beautiful and symbolic about building a foundation with gifts from people we love, and we hope you would want to contribute.
We very gladly also would accept bricks from friends and family not attending, and if you want to contribute, contact us at <a href="mailto:inger.og.mo@gmail.com?subject=Red bricks for grenhouse">inger.og.mo@gmail.com</a>.
Maybe we can get enough bricks so that the entire top row of the foundation is from people we love?

The brick must be a shade of red, and preferably in the standard measurements for Norway (see below). 
Some deviation is fine, and if its re-purposed that's just even more charming.
**Remember to have a note with your name around the brick, so we can note exactly where your stone will end up**
