title: The Greenhouse Dream
type: talks
---

Ever since we began dreaming of our own house, a greenhouse has been part of that dream.
And in these days where self-sufficiency is trending, its extra important with something that helps towards that goal.
The dream is to have a place we can cultivate in all year long, though we will need some years of experience before we get there.
In any way, a greenhouse would extend the growing season here in the North, and we are looking so much forward to beginning!

# How to give a gift
Dröfn, Mo's maid of honour, is responsible for the gifts, so you can contact her and let her know what you want to contribute.
She will keep track over what has already been given, and what is missing.
We will order the greenhouse and any accessories in the fall or before next spring, depending on time and opportunity to get it constructed.

Dröfn can be reached at <a href="mailto:ingerogmo.gaver@gmail.com?subject=Wedding gift for Inger and Mo">ingerogmo.gaver@gmail.com</a>

# Our wishes

Here you will find a list over what we are wishing for.
Maybe you want to contribute a little towards the main greenhouse, or maybe a greenhouse window is an appropriate gift?
Or parts of a window?
Or maybe a red brick for the greenhouse wall, as a symbol of our friendship?
We are grateful for any gift of any size.
