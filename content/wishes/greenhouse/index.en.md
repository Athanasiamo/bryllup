The greenhouse we have chosen is solid and can handle a lot of wind, a necessity where we live.
It has a core construction of wood and polycarbonate sheets.
We will place it on a brick wall, so that it becomes higher, more spacious, and grand.

With 10mm polycarbonate sheets, 20 337 NOK.

The price includes shipping, and an extra tall door to accommodate the brick wall.
